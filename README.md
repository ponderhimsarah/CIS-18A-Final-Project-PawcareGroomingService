# What does this program do?

This program allows the user to place orders and set appointments for delivery of services from a mobile pet grooming service. The program also prints a receipt detailing the user's order and the date the order was made. 

# How can I use this program?

To run this program, open or Copy/Paste the files in a java editor, assemble it, and run the program.

# How does this program work?

This is a program written in the Java language. 

In short, this program works by accepting inputs from the user after a series of prompts. The first input is handled by a switch statement, which creates an object to access a method that corresponds to the user's input choice. Inside these methods, a series of prompts, handled mostly by if statements, if/else statements, and do-while loops, are again displayed and input received. The user's choices are also gradually written into a text file as they are received. More objects are created and more methods are access to display more prompts and receive more input to include in the text file summary. Finally, a thank you message is displayed, followed by a similar message being written into the text file, marking the end of the program. 

# Why is this program useful?

This program aims to be useful by providing a quick, automated, and user friendly way to schedule appointments with a small business. This program could help cut down in-store wait times and face-to-face customer service interaction.
